# Guild Wars 2 Build Parser Discord Bot

### What it is:

GW2BPDB (I really need a better name for this...) does exactly what it says on the box: it parses build template codes (e.g., \[&DQMGPh0aKx8oARQBrhKGAA4TXwFfAQEB+RKJAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\]) and returns info about the build. Currently does not work for revenant builds, since they're weird (sorry revs!),

### Use:
Follow [the normal instructions for setting up a discord bot](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/#creating-the-bot-file). For permissions, you (may!) need:
 - Manage Roles
 - Manage Channels
 - Manage Webhooks*
 - Send Messages*
 - Manage Messages
 - Embed Links
 - Attach Files
 - Read Message History*
 - Add Reactions

 Permissions with a * next to them are absolutely needed; those without a * *may* be needed (still figuring that out!).

 ### Future:
 I'll get revs working soon, and figure out exactly which roles we need.

 ### Credits:
 - ArenaNet ([github](https://github.com/arenanet), [site](https://www.arena.net)) made Guild Wars 2. I didn't. I wish I did because it's awesome, but I'm not affiliated with them.
 - Asuras, because they are the best. If you disagree, your opinion is wrong.
 - Me, David Newman. Hi!
